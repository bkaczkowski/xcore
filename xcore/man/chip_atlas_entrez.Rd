\title{ChIP-Atlas gene level interaction matrix}
\format{
A \code{Matrix} with 23274 rows and 15133 columns. Row names corresponds to gene's
ENTREZ IDs, column names are formatted as TranscriptionFactor_Origin_Cell_ExperimentID
(eg. PARK7_Neural_SH-SY5Y_DRX000550, MLL-AF6_Blood_ML-2_DRX001460).

chip_atlas_entrez
}
\description{
A matrix describing interactions between ChIP-Atlas's ChIP-seq tracks
and human genes (hg38) as defined by \code{\link{promoters_f5}}. The interaction score
for each gene and transcription factor is a \emph{maximum} of transcription factor occurences
among the promoters associated with a given gene. Promoters were assigned to thier target
genes based on ENTREZ IDs.
