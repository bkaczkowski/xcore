\title{Filter signatures by coverage}
\usage{
filterSignatures(
  mae,
  min = 0.05,
  max = 0.95,
  ref_experiment = "Y",
  omit_experiments = c("Y", "U")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mae}{MultiAssayExperiment object.}

\item{min}{length one numeric between 0 and 1 defining minimum promoter
coverage for the signature to pass filtering.}

\item{max}{length one numeric between 0 and 1 defining maximum promoter
coverage for the signature to pass filtering.}

\item{ref_experiment}{string giving name of experiment to use for inferring
total number of promoters.}

\item{omit_experiments}{character giving names of experiments to exclude from
filtering.}
}
\value{
MultiAssayExperiment object with selected experiments filtered.
}
\description{
Filter signatures overlapping low or high number of promoters. Useful to get
rid of signatures that have very low variance.
